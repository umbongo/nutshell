# To-Do

## Done
- [x] Host Key Verification (TOFU) — implemented and documented.
- [x] Session tab black-tab bug — session name now visible.
- [x] Interface overhaul (`interface1`) — all 7 tasks shipped, README updated, branch merged to main.
- [x] Bug: Tooltip popup too small — switched to `TextWrapOff` so popup expands to content width.
- [x] Bug: Tab indicator boxes inconsistent — both "L" badge and connection dot are now uniform 16×16 boxes.
- [x] Feature: Session manager window (`session-manager`) — two-column window with profile list, CRUD, and connect.

## Bug: Tab elements disjointed
**Status:** Open
**Context:** In the tab strip, the session name, "L" badge, and connection dot are laid out as separate loose elements. When multiple sessions are open it is hard to tell which indicators belong to which tab.
**Root cause area:** `NewSessionTab` in `internal/ui/tab.go` — the HBox `[tabBtn, lBadge, indicator]` has no visible boundary separating one tab's elements from the next.
**Acceptance:** Each tab's session name, "L" badge, and connection dot are visually grouped inside a single bordered or padded box, so each session's indicators are clearly associated with its name.

## Feature: Light and dark interface theme
**Branch:** `theme-switcher`
**Status:** Open

### Prerequisites
- Create and switch to branch `theme-switcher` before making any changes.
- Use TDD: write a failing test first, then implement, then verify the test passes.
- Update README.md development-status table and any affected docs after all tests pass.

### Tasks
- [ ] 1. Add a `Theme` setting to `Settings` (values: `"light"` | `"dark"` | `"system"`); persist to `settings.ini`.
- [ ] 2. Implement a light variant and a dark variant of the terminal theme colours (background, foreground, cursor).
- [ ] 3. Add a theme selector (e.g. radio group or select widget) to the Settings window.
- [ ] 4. Apply the chosen theme immediately when the selector changes; no restart required.
- [ ] 5. Default to `"system"` (follow OS dark/light preference) on first run.

## Feature: Session manager window
**Branch:** `session-manager`
**Status:** Complete — awaiting merge to main.

### Prerequisites
- Create and switch to branch `session-manager` before making any changes.
- Use TDD: write a failing test first, then implement, then verify the test passes.
- Update README.md development-status table and any affected docs after all tests pass.

### Tasks
- [x] 1. Replace the `+` / connect dialog with a two-column session manager window (equal width columns).
- [x] 2. Left column — scrollable list of all saved profiles; clicking a profile selects it.
- [x] 3. Right column — "New connection" form: session name, hostname, port, username, password, key path.
- [x] 4. "Connect" button — opens the selected saved profile **or** the filled-in new-connection form as a session tab.
- [x] 5. "Save" button — persists a new or edited connection to the profile list in config; list refreshes immediately.
- [x] 6. "Delete" button — removes the selected saved profile after confirmation; list refreshes immediately.
- [x] 7. "Edit" button — populates the right-column form with the selected profile's details for modification.
- [x] 8. Ensure profiles are persisted to `settings.ini` and survive application restart.

## Feature: Interface overhaul (branch `interface1`)
**Branch:** `interface1` *(merged and deleted)*
**Status:** Complete

### Tasks
- [x] 1. Vertical scrollbar on terminal *(blocked — `fyne-io/terminal` has no public scrollback API)*
- [x] 2. Right-click context menu on session tab — "Start Logging" / "Stop Logging" toggle.
- [x] 3. "L" badge on tab — green when logging active, grey when inactive; updates immediately.
- [x] 4. Connection status dot on tab — green when connected, red when disconnected; sits right of "L".
- [x] 5. Hover tooltip — shows username, host:port, log file path, connection duration.
- [x] 6. Tab label font size at 80% of current theme size (derived, not hard-coded).
- [x] 7. Settings window copyright footer — `© 2026 Thomas Sulkiewicz`, separator above, theme-styled.
