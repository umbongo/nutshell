# UI Redesign — Working Notes (checkpoint)

**Status:** sub-projects 1 (design-system foundation) and 2 (AI Assist panel)
landed at v1.0.92/v1.0.96 (see "Landed since v1.0.96" below for what's
shipped since — approval-card fixes, prompt-gated dispatch, four-level auto
approve, markdown tables, role colour, smart scrolling, and pending command
batches). Native suite: **1,804 tests**, 0 failures. Integration suite
(`tests/integration/Run-Integration.ps1`): 17 cases (9 core + 5 AI +
`ui_gallery` + `approval_card_run_selected_settles` +
`ai_panel_opens_without_key`); `ui_gallery` now captures 10 `--ui-demo`
states x 4 themes = 40 images. Next action is sub-project 3 (main window
chrome: single toolbar replacing the menu bar, tab strip, status). Resume
from "Todo" below.

Branch: `main` — the redesign branch `ui-polish` was renamed to `main` on 2026-09-07 (the pre-redesign main was kept as branch `v1.0.76`). Now at v1.1.9.

## Decisions so far

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Scope | Full redesign, free rein on visual direction |
| First surface | AI Assist panel |
| Rendering | Stay on GDI/GDI+; build a proper design system on top (tokens, spacing scale, shared primitives, motion tokens). No Direct2D, no WebView2, no new runtime dependencies. |
| Verification | Originally Wine + Xvfb on the Linux box; abandoned because Wine's first-run configuration dialog blocked headless launch. **Now: the session moves to Windows so builds can be run natively and inspected in the user's browser/desktop.** |
| Roadmap (each gets its own spec + plan) | 1. Design-system foundation · 2. AI Assist panel · 3. Main window chrome (single toolbar replacing the menu bar, tab strip, status) · 4. Session Manager, first run, Settings · 5. Toasts + inline validation replacing MessageBox |

## Review findings (from code survey + marketing screenshots)

Strengths worth keeping: vector GDI+ icon set (`src/ui/icons.c`, 32 glyphs),
bundled Inter font, per-monitor-v2 DPI, four themes with contrast tests
(`src/core/ui_theme.*`), 200 ms dock slide, inline AI errors with Retry,
`settings_layout` as the model for a testable layout module.

Weaknesses, in impact order:

1. **Approval card** (`src/ui/chat_listview.c` `paint_cmd_card` / `paint_cmd_container`):
   "Blocked" repeats per row, long commands overlap the next row, WRITE/SAFE chips +
   checkboxes + three loud buttons (green/red/orange) compete. Palette is hardcoded
   (`chat_listview.c:66-87`), so it ignores the two light themes.
2. **No hover state in the chat list** — Allow/Deny/Retry/auto-approve links give no
   hover feedback and no hand cursor (`chat_listview.c` WM_MOUSEMOVE only drags selection).
3. **Toggle state nearly invisible** — Permit Write / Auto Approve signal on/off only via
   a small letter icon changing colour. Undock/Save icons have no labels or tooltips.
4. **Modal dead ends** — 26 `MessageBox` sites, incl. field validation and the "no API key"
   gate (`window.c:907`) which offers no way to open Settings. No toast mechanism exists.
5. **No designed empty states / first run** — one grey line in the chat, empty LISTBOX in
   Session Manager.
6. **Plain chrome** — classic text menu bar above the tab strip; shortcuts (Ctrl+W,
   Ctrl+=/-, PgUp/PgDn, Shift+Insert) never shown in the UI; no accelerator table.
7. **Debt that fights a refresh:**
   - Hardcoded colours outside the token system: `chat_listview.c` (27), `tabs.c` (16),
     `ai_chat.c` (12), `window.c` (14).
   - 5–6 copies of the RGB→COLORREF helper; two rounded-rect helpers; two DPI-scale macros
     (`S`, `CLV_SCALE`) plus `settings_scale()`.
   - Approval-card hit-testing (`on_lbuttondown`, ~180 lines) duplicates geometry from the
     paint code instead of sharing it.
   - AI panel `relayout()` uses inline magic numbers; button widths repeated in WM_CREATE.
   - Token struct has only 8 base colours + 14 chat colours; no hover/pressed/disabled/
     focus/elevation/success/warn/danger/link tokens.
   - `src/ui/*.c` is excluded from the Linux test build; only header-only pure logic and
     `src/core` modules are tested.

## Design-system foundation — original proposed shape (superseded 2026-09-07)

Kept for history; the approved version with all decisions is the spec named above.
As first proposed:

1. **Semantic tokens** — keep the 4 themes' 8 base colours; derive hover/pressed/disabled/
   elevation/focus tints in `src/core` via luminance math (testable); add explicit
   success/warning/danger/info/link per theme. Approval-card and tab colours move onto tokens.
2. **Spacing + type scale** — 4 px base grid, named steps (xs 4, sm 8, md 12, lg 16, xl 24);
   type ramp caption/body/title/mono; single DPI scale helper replacing `S`/`CLV_SCALE`.
3. **Shared primitives** — one `ns_draw` module: rounded rect with alpha, card, chip/pill,
   button (rest/hover/pressed/disabled/focus), icon+label; geometry structs in `src/core`
   (like `settings_layout`) so paint and hit-test share one source of truth.
4. **Motion tokens** — durations (fast 120 ms, base 200 ms) and one easing, shared by the
   dock slide, tab pulse and chat activity dot.
5. **Verification harness** — a hidden `--ui-demo` CLI flag that opens the AI panel with
   canned messages (user, AI with thinking, approval card in all states, error with Retry)
   so every screen state can be inspected without a live SSH session or API key.
6. **Tests** — token-coverage test that fails on new `RGB(` in `src/ui` outside `ns_draw`;
   derived-colour contrast tests; geometry tests for the shared primitives.

## Windows build environment (done 2026-09-06, session now on Windows)

The repo builds and tests natively on the Windows dev box (MSYS2 MINGW64 at
`C:\msys64`, gcc 15.2). Changes made, all on `ui-polish`, version bumped to 1.0.77:

- `Makefile` detects `OS=Windows_NT` and switches to pacman libs, `-lz`, `-static`,
  `windres`, a 16 MB test-runner stack, and links WinHTTP/GDI for the `#ifdef _WIN32`
  paths in `src/core`. Linux/vcpkg behaviour is unchanged.
- `src/term/libssh2.h` (test stub) moved to `tests/stubs/`, added to the include path
  only when no real libssh2 is found — removes the include-order pitfall.
- `TEST_TMP_DIR` in `test_framework.h` replaces literal `/tmp/` in file-writing tests.
- Three SSH/known-hosts tests that had rotted (never compiled on the Linux box, which
  lacked libssh2) now compile and run: 1,509 tests, 0 failures (was 1,464).
- Use `mingw32-make`; MSYS `make` breaks gcc's temp-file path. See CLAUDE.md.

**Finding from `make wintest` (first time it has ever run):** `NS_ICON_PASSWORD`
renders zero pixels. Its glyph is three zero-length `OP_MOVE/OP_LINE/OP_CLOSE/OP_FILLSTROKE`
"dots", which GDI+ draws as nothing even with round caps. The same trick is used for the
three dots on `NS_ICON_THINKING` and the LED on `NS_ICON_SERVER`, so those details are
invisible too. Fix belongs in foundation section 3 (shared primitives): add an `OP_DOT`
op backed by `GdipAddPathEllipse` and re-run `wintest` until it is green.

## Todo (compacted at the 2026-09-09 checkpoint)

Done, in order (details in the commit messages and the specs named):
- v1.0.77 native Windows build and test environment · v1.0.78 six review fixes
  (`2026-09-07-review-fixes-design.md`) · v1.0.80 lost lines after resize.
- v1.0.82–v1.0.92 design-system foundation, 10 of 10 tasks
  (`2026-09-07-design-system-foundation-design.md`; gates are exact allow-lists).
- v1.0.93–v1.0.96 AI Assist panel, 5 of 5 tasks (`2026-09-07-ai-assist-panel-design.md`).
- v1.0.97 approval-card crash and held-command workflow · v1.0.98 settled rows,
  Thinking remeasure · v1.0.99 chat list sticks to bottom · v1.1.0 terminal smart
  scrolling · v1.1.1 prompt-gated one-at-a-time dispatch · v1.1.2 four auto-approve
  levels (`2026-09-07-command-dispatch-and-auto-approve-levels.md`) · v1.1.3 collapsed
  Thinking stays collapsed, indicator placement · v1.1.4 markdown tables · v1.1.5 wheel
  trap · v1.1.6 colour by role, streaming Thinking measured · v1.1.7–v1.1.8 pending
  command batches (`2026-09-09-pending-command-batches.md`) · v1.1.9 focus not stolen
  from the terminal · v1.1.10 security fixes C1, C3/L3, C4/H9/H10/L4.
- BVT programme stage 1 (PR #10): harness helpers (posted input, dialog driving, pixel
  oracle, tiers), self-hosted runner `k2so-bvt`, `.github/workflows/bvt.yml`, ruleset
  on `main` (PRs only, BVT required). Plan: `2026-09-09-bvt-coverage.md`.

Open, in priority order:
- [ ] BVT batch A (18 cases, on branch `bvt-harness`, awaiting Opus review): commit as
      a PR; fix the two product bugs it found — Ctrl+W leaves the surviving tab blank
      and unresponsive; minimise/restore shifts a scrolled-back view by a page.
- [ ] BVT batches B (sessions, auth, host key, connection), C (terminal, clipboard,
      settings), D (AI extras) — 31 cases; `bvtuser` exists on tompi for auth cases.
- [ ] Security audit follow-ups (`2026-09-09-security-audit.md`, kept local): C2
      classifier allow-list + H2 platform; H3/H4 host-key fail-closed and default No;
      H5/H6 config in %APPDATA% with DPAPI and absolute save path; H7/H8 window-message
      hardening; then Medium and Low.
- [ ] Older review findings: AI-stream thread lifetime bugs; Session Manager phantom row.
- [ ] `md_render.c` renders at raw 96-DPI pixels — fold into sub-project 3.
- [ ] Sub-project 3 (main window chrome): spec first, mockups before choosing, as with
      sub-project 2.

Process (CLAUDE.md): Opus orchestrates each package and picks models; Fable reviews at
PR level; nothing reaches `main` without a green BVT.
